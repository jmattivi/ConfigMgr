SHORT DESCRIPTION
    Describes the types of management group connections that you can create 
    when using the Operations Manager Shell.


LONG DESCRIPTION
    To use the System Center Operations Manager 2012 cmdlets, you need to 
    establish a connection to an Operations Manager management group. There 
    are two types of connections that you can establish: persistent and 
    temporary. 

    If you have not previously used the Operations Console, the first time 
    you use the command shell you will be prompted for the name of a 
    management server to connect to. If you have used either the Operations
    Console or the command shell before, the command shell will attempt to
    connect to the last management server to which it had successfully 
    connected.

PERSISTENT CONNECTIONS

    To create a persistent management group connection, use the 
    New-SCOMManagementGroupConnection cmdlet. You can establish multiple 
    management group connections, but only one can be active at a time. 
    
    To set an active connection, use the Set-SCOMManagementGroupConnection cmdlet. 
    You can also use Set-SCOMManagementGroupConnection to change which management
    group connection is the active connection. After you have set an active
    connection, all cmdlets that you run will use this connection by default.

    To see which connection is the active connection, use the 
    Get-SCOMManagementGroupConnection cmdlet. This cmdlet lists all established
    management group connections and identifies the active connection.

TEMPORARY CONNECTIONS

    You can create a temporary connection to a management group that is not 
    the active management group connection by using the ComputerName and 
    Credential parameters for a cmdlet. If you do not specify credentials,
    the user's security context is used. 

OPENING THE OPERATIONS MANAGER SHELL FROM THE OPERATIONS CONSOLE

    You can open the Operations Manager Shell from the Operations Console by 
    using the following method: right-click an object in the user interface, 
    click Open, and then click Operations Manager Shell.

    When you use this method to open the command shell, the user interface 
    passes the object's instance ID to the command shell as an argument.
    After the command shell opens, it establishes a connection to the 
    management server, and then and runs the following command:

        Get-SCOMClassInstance -ID [Id of the selected object]

    You will see the command written to the console before it is run. The 
    instance returned from this cmdlet is stored in a variable named $context.
    You can use the $context variable within that PowerShell session to take 
    actions on the object.
