SHORT DESCRIPTION
    Describes how to create and associate a new Run As account.


LONG DESCRIPTION
    A Run As account is a named set of credentials that is presented by a Run 
    As profile for authentication when monitors, rules, or tasks are run. A 
    Run As account may be used by one or more Run As profiles.

    You can get existing Run As accounts by using the Get-SCOMRunAsAccount
    cmdlet.  To create a Run As account, use the Add-SCOMRunAsAccount cmdlet.
    You can manage the secure distribution of Run As accounts by using the 
    Get-SCOMRunAsDistribution and Set-SCOMRunAsDistribution cmdlets.
    
    There are many types of Run As accounts, each of which uses a unique
    set of parameters to create.  For examples of how to create each type
    of Run As account, type: "Get-Help Add-SCOMRunAsAccount -examples".


  EXAMPLES

    The following example script creates a Windows Run As account object, and
    sets it for approved secure distribution to all Agents and Management Servers.

        # Get credentials for the Run As account. The user name should be 
        # entered in the format "domain\user".
        $Creds = Get-Credential

        # Create the Run As account object.
        $RunAsAccount = Add-SCOMRunAsAccount -Windows `
                                             -Name "My New Run As Account" `
                                             -RunAsCredential $creds


        # Creates an array consisting of all Agent and Management Server objects
        # present in the Management Group.
        $distribution = ( Get-SCOMAgent ) +
                        ( Get-SCOMManagementServer )
                        
        # Approves the new account for secure distribution to all Agents
        # and Management Servers.
        Set-SCOMRunAsDistribution -RunAsAccount $runAsAccount `
                                  -MoreSecure `
                                  -SecureDistribution $distribution

    After you have created your Run As account, you must associate the 
    Run As account with a Run As profile to use the account. The following 
    commands get the Run As profile with which to associate the Run As
    account, the Run As account, and the class instance. Then, the last 
    command uses the Set-SCOMRunAsProfile cmdlet to add the Run As account
    to the Run As profile.
    
        $Profile = Get-SCOMRunAsProfile -DisplayName "My Run As Profile"
        $Account = Get-SCOMRunAsAccount -Name "My New Run As Account"
        $Instance = Get-SCOMClassInstance -DisplayName "Contoso financial SQL Servers"
        Set-SCOMRunAsProfile -Action "Add" -Profile $Profile -Account $Account -Instance $Instance
