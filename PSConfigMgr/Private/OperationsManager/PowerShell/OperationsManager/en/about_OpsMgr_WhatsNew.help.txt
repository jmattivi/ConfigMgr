SHORT DESCRIPTION
    Describes the new features that are included with the System Center
    Operations Manager 2012 cmdlets.

LONG DESCRIPTION
    The Operations Manager 2012 cmdlets are provided in a module that is 
    imported into the Operations Manager Shell. To start the Operations 
    Manager Shell from the Windows user interface, click Start, All Programs,
    System Center Operations Manager 2012, and then Operations Manager Shell. 
    To manually import the OM10 module into a Windows PowerShell session, 
    type "Import-Module OperationsManager" at the command prompt. 

    After you have opened an Operations Manager Shell session or manually 
    imported the module, you can run the individual cmdlets alone or
    combine them into scripts to automate tasks.

    The cmdlets in this module are only compatible with Operations Manager 
    2012. You can recognize the Operations Manager 2012 cmdlets by the "SCOM" 
    preceding the noun name. 

    To work with the Operations Manager 2007 cmdlets, see "Using the
    Deprecated Operations Manager 2007 Cmdlets" later in this topic.

WINDOWS POWERSHELL 2.0 SUPPORT
    Operations Manager 2012 adds support for Windows PowerShell 2.0, which 
    includes new cmdlets, parameters, and features, including the following:

      Remoting

        You can run commands on one or several remote computers by using a
        single command. You can run individual commands, or create a session
        in which you can run a series of commands. 

      Background Jobs

        Background jobs are commands that run asynchronously, returning the
        command prompt immediately, even if the command is still running. You
        can use background jobs to run commands in the background so that you
        can continue to use your session for other work while the command
        runs. You can run a background job on a remote computer by using the
        Invoke-Command cmdlet.

      Script Debugger

        You can use the cmdlet-based debugger to help you debug functions and
        scripts. The debugger cmdlets allow you to set and manage breakpoints,
        and let you display the call stack.

    For more information about PowerShell 2.0, see 
    about_Windows_PowerShell_2.0.


CONNECTIONS
    To use the Operations Manager 2012 cmdlets, you need to establish a
    connection to an Operations Manager management group. There are two 
    types of connections that you can establish: persistent and temporary. 
    To establish a new, persistent, management group connection, use the 
    New-SCOMManagementGroupConnection cmdlet. To establish a temporary 
    connection, use the ComputerName and Credential parameters for 
    the cmdlet.

    For more information about connections in Operations Manager 2012, see 
    about_OpsMgr_Connections.
    

NEW CMDLETS
    Operations Manager 2012 provides a full set of new cmdlets. For 
    information about how the Operations Manager 2007 cmdlets map to
    the Operations Manager 2012 cmdlets, see about_OpsMgr_Cmdlet_Names. 

    Following are some common tasks you might want to perform in Operations 
    Manager with their associated cmdlets.

                                                Enable-SCOMRule
                                                Disable-SCOMRule




WORKING WITH THE MANAGEMENT GROUP OBJECT
    Most objects returned by cmdlets in this module include properties and
    methods from the Operations Manager Software Development Kit (SDK) 
    (http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=194656). To see what methods 
    and properties are available on the objects returned by the cmdlets, 
    use the Get-Member cmdlet. For example:    

        Get-SCOMAlert | Get-Member

    For more information about Get-Member, type "Get-Help Get-Member".

    In the following example, the first command gets an agent object, and the 
    second command returns the management group object for the agent object:

        C:\PS> $Agent = Get-SCOMAgent -Name Server01
        C:\PS> $Agent.ManagementGroup

    NOTE:  The "ManagementGroup" property for an object provides programmatic 
    access to the management group that the object was retrieved from, using
    the Operations Manager SDK.  The Get-SCOMManagementGroup cmdlet can also
    be used to obtain a management group object.


USING THE DEPRECATED OPERATIONS MANAGER 2007 CMDLETS
    The Operations Manager 2007 cmdlets are deprecated in Operations Manager 
    2012 and will be removed in a future release. However, they are still 
    available for use while migrating from Operations Manager 2007. To use 
    the deprecated cmdlets, you must open a PowerShell session, load the 
    snap-in, and then run the startup script:

      C:\PS>Add-PSSnapIn Microsoft.EnterpriseManagement.OperationsManager.Client
      C:\PS>cd "$env:Program Files\System Center Operations Manager 2012\Console"
      c:\PS>.\Microsoft.EnterpriseManagement.OperationsManager.ClientShell.Startup.ps1
